## Overview

**Batch BlackList** is an efficient API for evaluating the reputation of IP addresses and domain names, specifically for mail server and DNSBL (DNS-based Blackhole List) monitoring. It checks addresses against multiple widely-used spam and blacklist services to help identify potential issues with email deliverability or domain/IP reputation.

## Supported Blacklists

This API currently supports a wide range of blacklist zones, including but not limited to:

- SpamCop
- SpamHaus Zen
- BARRACUDA
- Abuse.ro
- 0spam DNSBL

## Check Endpoint

### **Endpoint**
```

POST /check

````

### **Description**

The `/check` endpoint verifies whether the provided IP addresses or domain names are listed in DNS or domain blacklists. The response includes additional metadata such as PTR and A records, and optionally, reputation scores.

### **Request Body**

The request body must be a JSON object with the following parameters:

| Field         | Type              | Required | Description |

The response will be an array of results corresponding to each address in the request.

Each object includes:

| Field      | Type             | Description                             |
